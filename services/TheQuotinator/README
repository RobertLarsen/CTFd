Introduction
------------
The Quotinator is a vulnerable service meant for a CTF event. It is written in C
and listens on a TCP port. The users of this service can add quotes to the service
and these quotes can later be retrieved. The protocol is pretty simple and uses
telnet line endings.

Using the protocol you can add quotes, get the number of quotes from a named
author, get a numbered quote from a named author, list names of all authors if
you are logged in as the administrator, change user type to administrator and exit.

A session might look something like this:

 $ telnet localhost 9999
 Trying ::1...
 Trying 127.0.0.1...
 Connected to localhost.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 ADDQUOTE "Some Author" 13
 Hello, World!
 Quote received
 QUOTES "Some Author"
 1
 QUOTE "Some Author" 1
 Hello, World!
 QUIT
 Connection closed by foreign host.
 $

Adding quotes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adding quotes is done using the 'ADDQUOTE' command. The command is followed by the
authors name in double quotes followed by the length of the quote followed by <CRLF>
followed by the actual quote.

Retrieving number of quotes from an author
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You get the number of quotes for a specific author using the 'QUOTES' command. It is
followed by the name of the author in double quotes followed by <CRLF>. The service
will respond by telling how many quotes it knows of for the author.

Retrieving a single quote from an author
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'QUOTE' command retrieves a single quote. It is followed by the authors name in
double quotes followed by a number for which quote to retrieve followed by <CRLF>.

Change to admin user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Issue the 'ADMIN' command followed by the admin name in double quotes followed by
the admin password in double quotes followed by <CRLF>.

List names of all authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Issue the 'AUTHORS' command followed by <CRLF>. The first line in the response will
be the total number of authors. Following this is the list of author names.
This command can only be called by administrators.

Close down the connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Issue the 'QUIT' command followed by <CRLF>.

Bug
---
The programmer of this service has been sloppy with boundary checking so there are
multiple buffer overflows which can be leveraged for privilege escalation and even for
executing arbitrary code. The 'list_authors_exploit.rb' uses the buffer overflow for
getting administrator rights in the service and listing author names. This can then
be used for retrieving all quotes from all authors.

Also, the password for the admin access is specified on the command line. This means
that everybody can see it by running 'ps aux', maybe through another vulnerable service.

Fix
---
Check for size of data before all 'memcpy' calls and substitute 'strncpy' for 'strcpy'.

The password for the admin area can be hardcoded or read from a file.

Install
-------
1) Build an archive

 $ make TheQuotinator.tar.gz
 tar czf TheQuotinator.tar.gz --exclude-vcs -C .. TheQuotinator/Makefile TheQuotinator/quotinator-init TheQuotinator/src/main.c
 $

2) Copy archive to team server

 $ scp TheQuotinator.tar.gz robert@192.168.122.101:
 TheQuotinator.tar.gz                          100% 4352     4.3KB/s   00:00
 $

3) Become root on team server

 $ ssh robert@192.168.122.101
 $ sudo -s
 #

4) Install needed packages

 # apt-get -y install gcc

5) Unpack in /var/services on team server

 # mkdir /var/services
 # cd /var/services
 # tar xfz $HOME/TheQuotinator.tar.gz

6) Build executable from source.

 # cd TheQuotinator
 # make
 gcc -ggdb -Wall -c -D_DAEMONIZE -D_PARENT_SUPERVISION -o src/main.o src/main.c
 gcc  -o quotinator src/main.o
 #

7) Install init script

 # mv quotinator-init /etc/init.d/quotinator
 # chmod 700 /etc/init.d/quotinator
 # ln -s /etc/init.d/quotinator /etc/rc2.d/S99quotinator

8) Change the password in /etc/init.d/quotinator for each team

9) Start service

 # /etc/init.d/quotinator start

Game server
-----------
The flag deliver and check script requires the 'ruby' package to be installed on the game server.
