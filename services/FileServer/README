Introduction
------------
The FileServer is a vulnerable Java service used for a CTF event.
Using a Java client you can connect to the file server, create a
user account and upload or download files.

Bug
---
The fileserver does not check the path of the file you wish to upload
and it is possible to overwrite any file on the system, even the
fileserver itself. You can also crash the server and thus make the
run script relaunch it now with the overwritten jar file thus running
possibly malicious code.

To make it interesting the protocol is based on Javas object streams.

Install
-------
1) Build an archive

 $ ant archive
 ...
 $

2) Copy archive to team server

 $ scp FileServer.tar.gz robert@192.168.122.101:
 FileServer.tar.gz                            100%   63KB  62.8KB/s   00:00
 $

3) Become root on team server

 $ ssh robert@192.168.122.101
 $ sudo -s
 #

4) Install needed packages

 # apt-get -y install ant openjdk-6-jdk
 ......
 #

5) Unpack in /var/services on team server

 # mkdir /var/services
 # cd /var/services
 # tar xfz $HOME/FileServer.tar.gz
 # cd FileServer

6) Build jar

 # ant
 ....
 #

7) Add user for service

 # useradd --system --home /var/services/FileServer --shell /bin/false fileserver

8) Change owner

 # chown -R fileserver.fileserver .

9) Add init script

 # mv fileserver-init /etc/init.d/fileserver
 # ln -s ../init.d/fileserver /etc/rc2.d/S99fileserver
 # chmod +x /etc/init.d/fileserver

Game server
-----------
The check_fileserver script needs Java in the path and that the client code has been compiled.
On Ubuntu the packages 'openjdk-6-jdk' and 'ant' will do the trick.
