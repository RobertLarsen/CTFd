RabbitShare
===========

Introduction
------------
RabbitShare is a vulnerable service that provides users with a file sharing server.
The server accepts small text file uploads which are kept in a directory which is
accessible to other users but they will need to know the URL of the file.

Bug
---
Of course there is a problem. The source code does not have any problems as far as
I know (it is ugly thou), but the web server (the Apache web server) is configured
with directory listings turned on:

 Alias /RabbitShare /var/services/RabbitShare
 <Directory /var/services/RabbitShare>
 	Options Indexes
 </Directory>

This enables everybody to get a listing of all uploaded files on the server.

The service may be used in attacking other services as you can upload all types of
files. They will be renamed to have a '.txt' ending and may not be larger than one
megabyte but this doesn't stop a local include exploit or OS command injection
attack.

Fix
---
The fix is simply to deny the Indexes option:

 Alias /RabbitShare /var/services/RabbitShare
 <Directory /var/services/RabbitShare>
 	Options -Indexes
 </Directory>

and restart the web server.

Install
-------
1) Build an archive

 $ make
 tar czf RabbitShare.tar.gz --exclude-vcs --transform "s/src/RabbitShare/g" src
 $

2) Copy archive to team server

 $ scp RabbitShare.tar.gz robert@192.168.122.101:
 RabbitShare.tar.gz             100% 4007     3.9KB/s   00:00
 $

3) Become root on team server

 $ ssh robert@192.168.122.101
 $ sudo -s
 #

4) Install necessary packages on team server

 # apt-get -y install apache2 php5
 ......
 #

5) Unpack in /var/services on team server

 # mkdir /var/services
 # cd /var/services
 # tar xfz $HOME/RabbitShare.tar.gz
 # cd RabbitShare
 # chown -R www-data.www-data .
 # chmod g+w upload

6) Configure RabbitShare alias

 # cat > /etc/apache2/sites-available/RabbitShare <<EOF
 Alias /RabbitShare /var/services/RabbitShare
 <Directory /var/services/RabbitShare>
 	Options Indexes
 </Directory>
 EOF
 # ln -s ../sites-available/RabbitShare /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/001-RabbitShare

7) Restart Apache

 # apache2ctl restart

Game server
-----------
The flag deliver and check script requires the 'curl' package to be installed on the game server.

Verify
------
The installation is verified by visiting http://192.168.122.101/RabbitShare
and uploading a small text file. A file listing should be available at 
http://192.168.122.101/RabbitShare/upload
