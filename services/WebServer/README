YellowPages
===========

Introduction
------------
YellowPages is a vulnerable web server written in Node.js with a web service written in
HTML, JavaScript and Bash shell script.

You can save a name of a person and a description of that person and then later find
that description given the name.

Bug
---
There is a bug in both the two CGI scripts and in the web server itself.

CGI scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'add' script allows the user to execute any command with the privileges of the webserver.
This is done using shell expansion. For example try adding a user named "Bob" with the following
description: $(pwd)
The description is then substituted for the present working directory.
The 'search' script contains a similar bug. The name is not sanitized.

Web server
~~~~~~~~~~
The web server has a directory traversal vulnerability which means that any file that the user
running the server can read can be read through the service. Also the server supports a kind of
CGI execution which together with the directory traversal vulnerability can execute any program
with the privileges of the server. For instance, the following URL lists the content of the root
directory:
'http://192.168.122.101:8080/cgi-bin/../../../../../../bin/ls?-l&/'

Fix
---
Find the absolute path of the requested files and check if they lie under the directories
that the user is allowed to see. Also sanitize the user input in the CGI scripts.

Install
-------
1) Build an archive

 $ make
 tar czf YellowPages.tar.gz --exclude-vcs --transform "s/src/YellowPages/g" src
 $

2) Copy archive to team server

 $ scp YellowPages.tar.gz robert@192.168.122.101:
 YellowPages.tar.gz                            100%   63KB  62.8KB/s   00:00
 $

3) Become root on team server

 $ ssh robert@192.168.122.101
 $ sudo -s
 #

4) Install needed packages

 # apt-get -y install libssl-dev g++ make
 ......
 #

5) Build and install Node.js

 # cd /usr/src
 # wget -q http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.31/node-v0.10.31.tar.gz
 # tar xfz node-v0.10.31.tar.gz
 # cd node-v0.10.31/
 # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && make install
 ......
 #

6) Unpack in /var/services on team server

 # mkdir /var/services
 # cd /var/services
 # tar xfz $HOME/YellowPages.tar.gz
 # cd YellowPages

7) Add user for service

 # useradd --system --home /var/services/YellowPages --shell /bin/false yellow
 # chown -R yellow.yellow .

8) Add init script

 # mv init-script /etc/init.d/yellowpages
 # ln -s ../init.d/yellowpages /etc/rc2.d/S98yellowpages
 # chmod +x /etc/init.d/yellowpages

Game server
-----------
The flag deliver and check script require the 'lynx' package on the game server.

Verify
------
The installation is verified by visiting http://192.168.122.101:8080/
and adding a description of a user.

// vim: set syntax=asciidoc:
